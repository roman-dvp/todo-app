# User Story: Task List Display and Management

## Description
As a user, I want to view my tasks in a clear, organized list and be able to manage them efficiently, including marking them as complete, editing, and deleting them.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The task list should display:
   - Task title with visual emphasis
   - Completion status with a checkbox
   - Priority indicator (color or icon)
   - Due date (if set) with visual indication for overdue tasks
   - Actions (edit, delete)

2. Task management actions:
   - Clicking the checkbox should toggle completion status
   - Completed tasks should have visual differentiation (strikethrough, opacity)
   - Each task should have easily accessible edit and delete options
   - Delete action should require confirmation

3. List behavior:
   - Tasks should be initially sorted by creation date (newest first)
   - The list should be scrollable if it exceeds the viewport
   - Empty state should display a helpful message
   - Performance should remain smooth with 100+ tasks

4. Task reordering:
   - Users should be able to drag and drop tasks to reorder them
   - The new order should persist between sessions

## Technical Requirements
- Implement using React components with proper memoization
- Connect to Redux store for data and actions
- Implement drag and drop using react-beautiful-dnd
- Use efficient rendering techniques for large lists
- Save state changes to localStorage immediately
- Handle errors gracefully if storage operations fail

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, readable list with sufficient spacing
- Clear visual hierarchy to emphasize important information
- Touch-friendly targets for mobile users
- Smooth animations for state changes (completion, deletion)
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## Implementation Notes
- Consider virtualization for performance with large lists
- Use optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Add subtle animations for task completion and deletion

## Estimation
Story Points: 8
Estimated Development Time: 3 days

## Dependencies
- Redux store implementation
- Task data structure definition
- Drag and drop library integration
