# User Story: Local Storage Persistence

## Description
As a user, I want my tasks and application preferences to be saved automatically so I don't lose my data when I close the browser and can continue where I left off when I return.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Data persistence:
   - All tasks should be saved to localStorage automatically
   - Task changes (create, update, delete, reorder) should be persisted immediately
   - Application preferences (theme, filters, sort order) should be saved
   - Data should be loaded from localStorage when the application starts

2. Storage behavior:
   - Storage operations should be non-blocking to maintain UI responsiveness
   - Failed storage operations should be gracefully handled with user feedback
   - Storage format should be efficient and maintainable
   - Data integrity should be validated when loading from storage

3. User experience:
   - No explicit "save" action should be required from the user
   - Loading state should be shown briefly while retrieving data
   - Clear feedback should be provided if stored data cannot be retrieved
   - Recovery options should be offered if data corruption is detected

4. Technical considerations:
   - Storage operations should handle quota limitations
   - Version information should be included with stored data
   - Data migrations should be supported for future schema changes
   - Privacy and security best practices should be followed

## Technical Requirements
- Implement Redux persist for automatic state persistence
- Create storage service abstraction for localStorage operations
- Add error handling for storage failures
- Implement data version tracking and migration capability
- Add data validation when loading from storage

## UI/UX Considerations
- Unobtrusive loading states during data operations
- Clear error messages for storage failures
- Offline indicator when working without connectivity
- Helpful guidance for users experiencing data issues

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using a storage abstraction library for cross-browser compatibility
- Implement storage chunking for large datasets
- Add periodic cleanup of old or unused data
- Consider adding import/export functionality for data backup

## Estimation
Story Points: 3
Estimated Development Time: 1 day

## Dependencies
- Redux store implementation
- Application state structure
- Error handling system
