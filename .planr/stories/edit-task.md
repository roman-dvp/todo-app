# User Story: Edit Task

## Description
As a user, I want to edit existing tasks so I can update their details, correct mistakes, or adjust priorities and deadlines as my plans change.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Task editing interface:
   - Should pre-populate with the current task data
   - Should allow editing of all task fields (title, description, priority, due date)
   - Should use the same validation rules as task creation
   - Should clearly indicate that the user is editing an existing task

2. Editing functionality:
   - Changes should only be saved when the user explicitly submits the form
   - A cancel option should be available to discard changes
   - Validation errors should be clearly displayed
   - Successful edits should show a confirmation message

3. Edit access:
   - Edit option should be easily accessible from the task list
   - Should be available through a context menu or dedicated edit button
   - Should support keyboard shortcuts for power users

4. Data handling:
   - The task's "updated at" timestamp should be refreshed
   - Previous task data should be preserved until successful submission
   - Task order in the list should be maintained unless sort criteria have changed

## Technical Requirements
- Reuse the task form component with modifications for edit mode
- Implement form state management with React Hook Form
- Add validation with Zod schema
- Update Redux store and localStorage on successful edit
- Track "updated at" metadata for audit purposes

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear distinction between creation and editing modes
- Visual consistency with the creation form
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessible form controls with proper labeling
- Keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Notes
- Consider implementing field-level change tracking
- Add confirmation if user attempts to navigate away with unsaved changes
- Support for inline editing of simple fields could be considered
- Maintain focus on the most relevant field when form opens

## Estimation
Story Points: 3
Estimated Development Time: 1 day

## Dependencies
- Task creation form component
- Redux actions for updating tasks
- Form validation utilities
