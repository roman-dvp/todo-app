# User Story: Theme Toggle (Light/Dark)

## Description
As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes so I can customize the application's appearance to my preference and reduce eye strain in different lighting conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Theme functionality:
   - The application should offer light and dark themes
   - A visible toggle control should be accessible from any screen
   - Theme should change immediately when toggled without page reload
   - Theme preference should persist between sessions

2. Theme variants:
   - Light theme should use light backgrounds with dark text
   - Dark theme should use dark backgrounds with light text
   - Both themes should maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
   - Accent colors should be adjusted appropriately for each theme

3. System preference:
   - By default, the application should respect the user's system preference
   - Manual selection should override system preference
   - A "System Default" option should be available to revert to system preference

4. Theme implementation:
   - All UI elements should adapt to the selected theme
   - No hard-coded colors should override theme settings
   - Custom UI components should respect the current theme
   - Third-party components should be styled to match the theme

## Technical Requirements
- Implement CSS variables for theme colors
- Store theme preference in Redux
- Persist preference to localStorage
- Use media query to detect system preference
- Add proper HTML attributes for theme switching

## UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive toggle control with clear visual indication
- Smooth transition animation between themes
- Consistent application of theme across all components
- Proper contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance)
- Clear icon or label for the theme toggle

## Implementation Notes
- Consider implementing CSS variables at the root level
- Use a ThemeProvider context for React components
- Add transition effects for a smoother experience
- Ensure that all UI elements have theme-aware styling
