# User Story: Delete Task

## Description
As a user, I want to delete tasks that I no longer need so I can keep my task list clean and focused on relevant items.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Delete interface:
   - Each task should have a clearly identifiable delete option
   - Delete option should be accessible but not easy to trigger accidentally
   - Delete action should require confirmation to prevent mistakes
   - Confirmation dialog should clearly state the action's permanence

2. Deletion behavior:
   - Successfully deleted tasks should be immediately removed from the UI
   - A success message should confirm the deletion
   - An undo option should be available briefly after deletion
   - Task count and filters should update to reflect the deletion

3. Bulk deletion:
   - Option to delete all completed tasks
   - Bulk delete should require confirmation
   - Should show the number of tasks that will be deleted
   - Should provide success feedback after completion

4. Data handling:
   - Deleted tasks should be permanently removed from storage
   - Deletion history could be temporarily maintained for undo functionality
   - Deleted task IDs should not be reused for new tasks

## Technical Requirements
- Implement delete action in Redux store
- Remove task data from localStorage
- Add confirmation dialog component
- Implement temporary undo functionality using task history
- Handle keyboard shortcuts for deletion with confirmation

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clear but safe positioning of delete controls
- Distinct styling for destructive actions
- Accessible confirmation dialog
- Smooth animation for task removal
- Clear feedback after successful deletion

## Implementation Notes
- Consider implementing a "soft delete" with undo period
- Add keyboard shortcut (e.g., Delete key) with confirmation
- Ensure confirmation dialogs are keyboard navigable
- Optimize bulk deletion for performance with large lists

## Estimation
Story Points: 3
Estimated Development Time: 1 day

## Dependencies
- Task list component
- Confirmation dialog component
- Redux actions for task management
- Toast/notification system for feedback
