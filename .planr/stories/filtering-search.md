# User Story: Task Filtering and Search

## Description
As a user, I want to filter and search my tasks so I can quickly find specific tasks or focus on certain categories of tasks based on their status, priority, or content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application should provide filters for:
   - Task status (All, Active, Completed)
   - Priority level (All, Low, Medium, High)
   - Due date ranges (Today, This Week, This Month, Overdue)

2. Search functionality:
   - A search field should allow filtering tasks by title and description text
   - Search should be case-insensitive
   - Search should update results as the user types (with debounce)
   - Empty search field should show all tasks (subject to other filters)

3. Filter behavior:
   - Multiple filters should be combinable (e.g., show high priority active tasks)
   - Applied filters should be clearly indicated in the UI
   - Filters should persist between application sessions
   - A "Clear Filters" option should reset all filters

4. Results display:
   - The task count should update to reflect filtered results
   - Empty results should display an appropriate message
   - Filter changes should be reflected immediately in the task list

## Technical Requirements
- Implement filter state in Redux store
- Use selectors with memoization for efficient filtering
- Implement debounced search input to prevent excessive re-renders
- Persist filter state to localStorage
- Update URL query parameters to reflect current filters (for sharing/bookmarks)

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive filter controls
- Visual indicators for active filters
- Mobile-friendly filter interface
- Keyboard shortcuts for common filter combinations
- Accessible controls with proper labels and ARIA attributes

## Implementation Notes
- Consider implementing filter presets for common combinations
- Use efficient filtering algorithms that scale with large task lists
- Implement URL synchronization for shareable filtered views
- Consider filter history for quick switching between recent filter states

## Estimation
Story Points: 5
Estimated Development Time: 2 days

## Dependencies
- Redux store with task data
- UI components for filter controls
- URL synchronization utilities
