# Todo App - Project Idea

## Overview
Todo App is a modern, responsive React application designed to help users organize and manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application provides a clean, intuitive interface for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks, with a focus on simplicity and usability.

## Problem Statement

## Solution
Our Todo App strikes this balance by offering:
- Simple, intuitive task creation and management
- Task organization through priorities, filters, and search
- Visual indicators for task status and priority
- Responsive design that works across all devices
- Offline capability with local storage
- Light/dark theme for visual comfort
